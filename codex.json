    "notes": {
      "context": "Genesis opens with a majestic, poetic account of creation from a void. John's Gospel deliberately echoes this language, framing 'the Word' (Logos) as the divine agent of a new spiritual creation in Christ, present from the very beginning.",
      "reflection": "Every day is a new creation, a personal 'let there be light,' Jeff. How can you partner with the Word today to bring order, beauty, and goodness into your own small corners of the world?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "Abram is promised descendants as numerous as the stars, a seemingly impossible feat. His belief is 'credited to him as righteousness.' In Mark, a desperate father utters one of the most honest prayers in scripture, confessing both his faith and his doubt simultaneously.",
      "reflection": "True faith is not the absence of doubt, but the courage to cry out 'I believe; help my unbelief!' in the face of it, Jeff. Where do your faith and doubt intersect today?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "The verse from Isaiah uses the powerful imagery of snow to describe the cleansing power of God's forgiveness, transforming deep, permanent stains into pure white. Paul's letter to the Ephesians clarifies that this cleansing is 'grace'—an unearned gift, not something achieved by our own works.",
      "reflection": "Grace is the undeserved gift that costs us nothing and cost God everything, Jeff. How does recognizing grace as a gift, rather than a wage, change how you view yourself and others?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "The 'Shema Yisrael' from Deuteronomy is the central commandment of Judaism, calling for a total, all-encompassing love for God. Paul, in Galatians, argues that for Christians, this state of love is not achieved by rigid adherence to law, but is a natural 'fruit' produced by the Holy Spirit dwelling within.",
      "reflection": "Are you trying to follow a checklist of rules, Jeff, or cultivating an inner environment where the fruits of the Spirit can grow naturally?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "Proverbs defines the beginning of wisdom as 'the fear of the Lord'—a reverent awe and respect. Paul turns this on its head, stating that the central message of Christianity, the crucified Christ, appears as 'foolishness' to the world's conventional wisdom, yet it is the ultimate expression of God's power and wisdom.",
      "reflection": "Sometimes the wisest path feels like the most foolish one to the outside world, Jeff. Are you willing to embrace the 'foolishness' of God to find true wisdom?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "In the face of unimaginable loss, Job's initial response is one of worship and acceptance, not curse. He holds onto God despite his suffering. Paul provides the theological framework for this, explaining how suffering can produce perseverance and character, ultimately leading to a hope that does not disappoint.",
      "reflection": "Hope is not the absence of suffering, but the belief in a purpose and a future beyond it, Jeff. How can you find hope not just in spite of your trials, but through them?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "The prophet Micah boils down God's complex requirements into three simple actions: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. In Philippians, Paul presents Christ himself as the ultimate example of this humility, emptying himself and taking the form of a servant.",
      "reflection": "True greatness in the Kingdom of God is measured by the depth of your service and the sincerity of your humility, Jeff. How can you serve today?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "Amos, a prophet of social justice, dismisses empty religious ceremony, calling instead for a torrent of righteousness. Jesus, in Matthew's Gospel, makes this personal and tangible: he states that serving the poor, the sick, and the imprisoned is equivalent to serving him directly.",
      "reflection": "Your love for God is directly measured by your love for the 'least of these,' Jeff. Where can you let justice roll down like a river in your community?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "Psalm 23 is the most famous depiction of God as a personal, caring shepherd who provides, protects, and guides. Jesus explicitly claims this title for himself in John's Gospel, contrasting the 'good shepherd' who lays down his life for the sheep with the 'hired hand' who flees from danger.",
      "reflection": "The Shepherd knows you by name, Jeff. In a world of noise and anonymity, what does it mean to be known and cared for by a God who would lay down His life for you?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "Isaiah prophesies a great light dawning for those living in deep darkness, a promise of hope and liberation. Jesus makes the radical declaration, 'I am the light of the world,' positioning himself as the fulfillment of this ancient prophecy and the ultimate source of spiritual illumination.",
      "reflection": "Light exposes, guides, and gives life, Jeff. How can you not only walk in the light, but also reflect it into the dark corners of the world around you?",
