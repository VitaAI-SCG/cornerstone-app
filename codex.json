      "context": "The opening of Genesis is a majestic, poetic account of creation from a void, establishing God's power and order. John's Gospel deliberately echoes this, reframing 'the Word' as the divine agent of a new spiritual creation in Christ.",
      "reflection": "Every sunrise offers a new beginning, a personal 'let there be light.' How can we partner with God in creating order and goodness in our own small corners of the world today?",

      "context": "Abram (later Abraham) is promised descendants as numerous as the stars, a seemingly impossible feat. His belief is 'credited to him as righteousness.' In Mark, a desperate father utters one of the most honest prayers in scripture, confessing both his faith and his doubt simultaneously.",
      "reflection": "True faith is not the absence of doubt, but the courage to cry out 'I believe; help my unbelief!' in the face of it. Where do our faith and doubt intersect today?",

    "notes": {
      "context": "The verse from Isaiah uses the powerful imagery of snow to describe the cleansing power of God's forgiveness, transforming deep, permanent stains into pure white. Paul's letter to the Ephesians clarifies that this cleansing is 'grace'â€”an unearned gift, not something achieved by our own works.",
      "reflection": "Grace is the undeserved gift that costs us nothing and cost God everything. How does recognizing grace as a gift, rather than a wage, change how we view ourselves and others?",
