And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.",

Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God\u2019s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters. God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light. God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light \u201cday\u201d, and the darkness he called \u201cnight\u201d. There was evening and there was morning, the first day."

        "context": "Genesis opens with a majestic, poetic account of creation from a void. John's Gospel deliberately echoes this language, framing 'the Word' (Logos) as the divine agent of a new spiritual creation in Christ, present from the very beginning.",
        "reflection": "Every day is a new creation, a personal 'let there be light.' How can we partner with the Word today to bring order, beauty, and goodness into our own small corners of the world?",
