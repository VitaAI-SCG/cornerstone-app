        "context": "Proverbs defines the beginning of wisdom as 'the fear of the Lord'\u2014a reverent awe and respect. Paul turns this on its head, stating that the central message of Christianity, the crucified Christ, appears as 'foolishness' to the world's conventional wisdom, yet it is the ultimate expression of God's power and wisdom.",
        "reflection": "Sometimes the wisest path feels like the most foolish one to the outside world. Are we willing to embrace the 'foolishness' of God to find true wisdom?",
