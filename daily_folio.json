I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.\u201d\nAbram said, \u201cLord Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?\u201d\nAbram said, \u201cBehold, to me you have given no children: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.\u201d\nBehold, Yahweh\u2019s word came to him, saying, \u201cThis man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.\u201d\nYahweh brought him outside, and said, \u201cLook now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.\u201d He said to Abram, \u201cSo will your offspring be.\u201d\nHe believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness.\n"

            "text": "Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.\nImmediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him.\nHe asked the scribes,\n\u201cWhat are you asking them?\u201d\nOne of the multitude answered, \u201cTeacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;\nand wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren\u2019t able.\u201d\nHe answered him,\n\u201cUnbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.\u201d\nThey brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.\nHe asked his father,\n\u201cHow long has it been since this has come to him?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cFrom childhood.\nOften it has cast him both into the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.\u201d\nJesus said to him,\n\u201cIf you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.\u201d\nImmediately the father of the child cried out with tears, \u201cI believe. Help my unbelief!\u201d\n"

        "context": "Abram (later Abraham) is promised descendants as numerous as the stars, a seemingly impossible feat. His belief is 'credited to him as righteousness.' In Mark, a desperate father utters one of the most honest prayers in scripture, confessing both his faith and his doubt simultaneously.",
        "reflection": "True faith is not the absence of doubt, but the courage to cry out 'I believe; help my unbelief!' in the face of it. Where do our faith and doubt intersect today?",
