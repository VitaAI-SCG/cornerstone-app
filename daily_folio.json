    "notes": {
        "context": "The prophet Micah boils down God's complex requirements into three simple actions: act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly. In Philippians, Paul presents Christ himself as the ultimate example of this humility, emptying himself and taking the form of a servant.",
        "reflection": "True greatness in the Kingdom of God is measured not by power or status, but by the depth of our service and the sincerity of our humility. How can we serve today?",
