This is crucial; it highlights *agency*\u2014a deliberate, proactive pursuit of reconciliation, not simply the absence of conflict.  This contrasts with a purely passive understanding of peace.\n\n### Historical Insight:\n\nA surprising aspect of the context of Matthew 5:9 is its connection to Jewish concepts of peace. While often viewed solely through a Christian lens, the concept of *shalom* (\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd) in the Hebrew Bible deeply influenced Jesus' teaching.  *Shalom* encompasses far more than simple absence of conflict; it implies wholeness, well-being, and right relationship with God, oneself, and others.  Jesus' use of *eir\u0113nopoioi* reflects this holistic understanding of peace, challenging the common perception of  peace as merely ceasefire or the absence of war, emphasizing instead a proactive role in restoring broken relationships.  Historians have recently unearthed evidence suggesting that, prior to the Roman occupation, various Jewish sects had their own methods of conflict resolution and community mediation, which Jesus may have been building upon.  This shows peacemaking wasn't a novel concept.\n\n### Theological Connection:\n\nBoth passages connect to the systematic theological concept of *divine shalom*.  This concept, rooted in the Hebrew understanding of *shalom* and expanded upon in Christian theology, emphasizes God's ultimate desire for harmony and right relationships throughout creation.  Matthew 5:9 highlights that those who actively work towards restoring this divine shalom are blessed and considered children of God, mirroring God's own nature.  Romans 12:18, while seemingly less overtly theological, emphasizes our individual responsibility to actively participate in bringing about this divine shalom, so far as it is within our power. This aligns with the broader Christian understanding of *participation in God's mission* (Missio Dei).\n\n### A Scholar's Question:\n\nGiven the inherent limitations on human agency (we cannot force peace; some conflicts are intractable), what does it mean practically and ethically to strive for peace as described in Matthew 5:9 and Romans 12:18?  How do we balance the call to be peacemakers with the realities of injustice and oppression, situations where \"peace\" might necessitate challenging existing power structures?  Where does this call leave us when faced with conflicts that we cannot resolve alone?\n"}
