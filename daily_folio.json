It's a compound word: *eir\u0113n\u0113* (peace) + *poie\u014d* (to make, to do).  It's not simply about *having* peace, but actively *making* or *creating* peace.  This is a dynamic, verb-based understanding of peace, implying proactive engagement rather than passive acceptance.  This contrasts with a more static understanding of peace as mere absence of conflict.  The active creation of peace requires effort, initiative, and often, sacrifice.\n\n### Historical Insight:\n\nA surprising aspect of the context of Matthew 5:9 is the understanding of peace in first-century Judaism.  While often associated with passive acceptance, Jewish peacemaking often involved active mediation and reconciliation within the community.  The concept of *shalom* in Hebrew encompassed wholeness, well-being, and right relationships \u2013 going beyond simply the absence of conflict.  Jesus's teaching builds upon this tradition, but emphasizes a radical, other-focused peacemaking that extends even to enemies. This challenges the more limited, group-focused aspects of Jewish peacemaking practices.\n\n### Theological Connection:\n\nBoth passages connect to the theological concept of *agape* love.  *Agape* isn't simply affection or sentiment; it's a self-giving, sacrificial love that seeks the good of the other, even at personal cost.  Matthew 5:9 links peacemaking to being called \"children of God,\" reflecting the character of God who actively pursues reconciliation with humanity.  Romans 12:18, while emphasizing personal responsibility for peace, is grounded in *agape*:  striving for peace \"as far as it depends on you\" acknowledges limitations while emphasizing the proactive role of Christian love in conflict resolution.  True peacemaking flows from and reflects this divine love.\n\n### A Scholar's Question:\n\nHow do we reconcile the call for peacemaking in Matthew 5:9 and Romans 12:18 with the necessity of righteous resistance to injustice or oppression?  Where is the line between peacemaking and complicity, and how do we discern that line in complex social and political contexts?  This requires careful consideration of the historical and cultural context of both passages and a nuanced understanding of *agape* love in action.\n"}
