When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?   When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?\u2019  \u201cThe King will answer them, \u2018Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers,  you did it to me.\u2019"

        "context": "Amos, a prophet of social justice, dismisses empty religious ceremony, calling instead for a torrent of righteousness. Jesus, in Matthew's Gospel, makes this personal and tangible: he states that serving the poor, the sick, and the imprisoned is equivalent to serving him directly.",
